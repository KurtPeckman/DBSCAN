DBSCAN (Density based spatial clustering of applications with noise) algorithm has 2 parameters.
  1) eps: maximum radius of neighbourhood
  2) minPts: minimum number of of points in the eps-neighborhood of a point
eps-neighborhood of a point 'q' is defined by 
      N.eps(q)={p belongs to D| dist(p,q)<=eps }
      
Types of points:
  1) core point: dense neighbourhood (eps neighborhood containing points >= minPts)
  2) border point: A points which belongs to some cluster but its neighborhood is not dense.
  3) outlier/noise: A point which doesnt belong to any cluster
  
Types of linkages:
  1) Directly density-reachable: p is directly density reachable from q if:
    a) p belongs to N.eps(q)
    b) q is a core point |N.eps(q)|>=minPts
  2) Density-reachable: p is density reachable from q if:
    a) there are chain of points (p1..pn), p1=q and pn=p, such that p(i+1) is directly density reachable from p(i). [transitive property]
  3) Density-connected: p is density connected to q if:
    a) If both p and q are density connected from another point o.


Important note: linkages are not commutativein nature that is if p is density reachabel from q, then it does not mean that q is density reachable from p


DBSCAN Algorithm:
Step1: Arbitrarily select a point p
Step2: Retrieve all points that are density reachabel from p ( If p is core point then a cluster is formed, if p is a border point then no cluster is formed and algorithm selects next point).
Step3: Repeat above two steps until all points are processed.


Cons of DBSCAN:
It is highly sensity to eps and minPts parameters, resulting to very different clustering result for each setting
